      <li>2 teaspoons dry mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
      <li>6 (4 ounce) fillets trout</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Mix together paprika, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, cumin, 
        black pepper, white pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a heavy cast iron pan on high heat until extremely hot, about 
        10 minutes. While the pan is heating, pour 3/4 cup melted butter 
        into a shallow dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each fillet into butter, turning once to coat both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle both sides of fillets with spice mixture; gently pat 
        mixture onto fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, place fillets into the hot pan without crowding. 
        Carefully pour about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each fillet. 
        Cook until fish has a charred bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn fillets 
        and spoon about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue cooking until bottoms are charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat 
        with remaining fish. Serve and enjoy!
